Or rather, trying to make sense of how I'm still alive. The past few days have been a blur of sleepless nights, diaper changes, and endless crying. Mine, not the baby's.

I thought I was prepared for motherhood. I read all the books, attended the classes, had all the right gear... but nothing could've prepared me for this crushing feeling of being completely overwhelmed. It's like my emotions are in a never-ending spin cycle - one minute I'm elated and the next, I'm drowning in despair.

I look at that tiny human lying beside me, and for a second, everything feels okay. But then reality sets in, and I realize I have no idea what I'm doing. No idea how to make this work. No idea how to be good enough. The weight of responsibility is suffocating me.

Sometimes, when the baby's asleep, I'll sit there staring at her tiny hands or feet, feeling like I'm just going through the motions. Like I'm a robot programmed to feed, burp, and cuddle on repeat. And then the tears come, because it all feels so... empty. So unfulfilling.

I know I should be grateful for this precious gift. I do! But in these moments, when my emotions are raw and exposed, I just feel like I'm drowning in a sea of uncertainty. Like I'm lost at sea with no lifeline in sight.

I guess that's what they mean by the ""fourth trimester."" This weird limbo where you're still recovering from childbirth but also trying to figure out this new person you've become. It's like I've been transported to a parallel universe, and everything feels foreign.

Everyone keeps telling me this is normal, that I should be feeling overwhelmed, but honestly, it feels like no one understands.

I used to be the one who knew what was going on, who had a handle on everything. Now, I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of diapers and feedings, and the thought of doing anything else makes me want to crawl back into bed. My mind is a jumbled mess of worries - will I ever get my body back? Can I still fit into those jeans from high school?

Sometimes, when no one's looking, I'll let out a little sob. It's like my body is releasing all the pent-up emotions, all the frustration and fear that's been building up inside me. But then I'll quickly wipe away my tears and put on a brave face. After all, I'm supposed to be a strong mother, aren't I?

But sometimes, when it's just me and my baby, I let myself feel things. Like today, when we were lying in bed together, and I felt like I was melting into her tiny fingers. It was like our hearts were beating as one, and for a moment, everything seemed right with the world.

I know I'm not alone in this feeling, that there are countless women out there who've been through this too. But still, it's hard to shake off the feeling that I should be stronger, that I should be able to handle all of this on my own.

I know this isn't normal, right? This isn't what everyone says about motherhood being this magical, euphoric experience. Because honestly, sometimes it feels like I'm just going through the motions. Like I'm a robot programmed to produce diapers, onesies, and endless loops of white noise.

Don't get me wrong, there are moments – fleeting moments – where everything feels okay. When my baby looks up at me with those big brown eyes and smiles, or when we're both laughing together during tummy time. But then the guilt creeps in. The guilt that I'm not doing enough, that I should be doing more.

I know it's normal to feel overwhelmed, but sometimes it feels like everyone else has their lives figured out except me. Like all these other moms out there are just effortlessly juggling work, parenting, and social media with a smile on their face. And then there's me, just trying not to lose my mind in the midst of this chaos.

I guess what I'm really saying is that it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to feel like you're drowning in a sea of dirty diapers and sleepless nights. It's okay to admit that sometimes the thought of going another day without a shower or a decent cup of coffee feels like too much to bear.

But what I'm really hoping is that someday soon, things will get better. That my baby will grow up enough for me to have some semblance of sanity restored. That I'll be able to remember who I was before all this – the person who loved yoga, good books, and decent coffee.

So, what does this mean? It means maybe - just maybe - I can learn to navigate these new waters without drowning. It means taking things one step at a time and finding solace in the little things: a warm bath, a good book, or a quiet moment to myself.

The early days were a blur of sleepless nights, endless feeding sessions, and moments of pure elation when that tiny human would gaze up at me with those big, round eyes.

But then the fog started to lift, and reality set in. I realized I was struggling. Not just the usual new mom blues, but full-on depression. It crept up on me like a thief in the night, stealing my joy and leaving me feeling hopeless and isolated.

I tried to shake it off, telling myself I was being ridiculous. After all, I had a beautiful baby girl, a loving partner, and a supportive family. What did I have to be sad about?

But the sadness persisted. It seeped into every waking moment, coloring my thoughts and emotions like a perpetual gray mist. And then came the tears. Oh, the tears. They flowed freely, like a never-ending river of despair.

It wasn't until my doctor sat me down and asked how I was really doing that I finally broke down and confessed. She listened patiently, her expression kind but not overly sympathetic. ""You're not alone,"" she said. ""Many women struggle with postpartum depression. And you know what? Exercise can be a game-changer.""

At first, the thought of putting on my workout gear again seemed laughable. I felt like a sloth in a world that moved at lightning speed. But something about her words resonated deep within me. Maybe it was the idea of taking control back from this beast that had taken up residence in my mind.

So I started small – short walks around the block, gentle stretches on the floor. And then, slowly but surely, I began to build momentum. The more I moved, the better I felt. It wasn't a magic cure-all, but it was something.

I wake up every morning, hoping that today will be different. That the weight on my chest will lift, and the darkness will recede. But it doesn't. It just stays there, pressing down on me like a physical force. Sometimes I feel like screaming, throwing open the window and letting out all the pent-up frustration. Other times, I just want to curl up into a ball and disappear.

I'm not even sure what's real anymore. The world outside is a blur of news headlines and panic buying. My own reality feels like a distant dream, one that I can't quite grasp. And then there are these thoughts - the whispers in my ear, telling me that maybe this isn't so bad after all. That maybe it's time to just let go.

It's exhausting trying to keep up with the narrative of normalcy. Trying to be the person I used to be before motherhood, before lockdown. It feels like I'm stuck in a never-ending loop of anxiety and self-doubt. And the worst part is that no one seems to understand what it's really like. They just pat me on the back, tell me to keep going, without grasping the magnitude of this mental health crisis.

I've been seeing a psychologist - a kind soul who listens without judgment. She asked me to write down my thoughts and feelings, and I poured out my heart onto those pages. It's like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders knowing that someone is there to support me.

And then there's the spirituality thing. I never knew I had it in me until now. It's like discovering a hidden talent or a secret language. I feel more grounded, more centered. Like I'm part of something bigger than myself.

I know it sounds crazy, but sometimes I catch myself thinking about how life will never be the same.
