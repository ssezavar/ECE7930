The tiny human attached to my chest is the most precious thing I've ever seen, but honestly, most days it feels like a burden too. I mean, who knew having a baby could be so... overwhelming?\n\nSometimes, when I'm lying in bed at 3 am, going over every little thing that went wrong during the day, those pesky thoughts creep in: \"What if I don't produce enough milk?\" \"Am I doing this mom thing right?\" It's like my brain is a never-ending loop of self-doubt and anxiety. And when the baby starts crying, it feels like my mind is going to shatter into a million pieces.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are moments when everything feels okay – when that little face lights up during a feeding or when we have a snuggle session that makes my heart skip a beat. But those moments are few and far between. Mostly, I just feel like I'm sleepwalking through life, waiting for someone to tell me what's going on.\n\nI know it sounds silly, but sometimes I worry that the other moms out there aren't struggling like I am. That they have some secret formula for being perfect parents, and I'm just stuck in this never-ending cycle of guilt and self-doubt. But deep down, I know that can't be true – everyone has their own battles to fight.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that it's okay not to be okay. It's okay to feel like you're drowning sometimes.
